Hi, I am Henry, a natural language processing engineer & quantum computing researcher, accidentally growing into a Ph.D. in Computer Science. My current interests range from machine learning and natural language processing in multi social media platforms (Reddit, Twitter, Weibo, etc.) to quantum computing research in the tech industry. 

I'm currently focuses on leveraging social media as an alternative data source for disease surveillance.


I studied BS, Electrical Engineering at [HPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henan_Polytechnic_University) and MS, Computer Science (with a focus on natural language processing) at [North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina).
